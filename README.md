Abstract
This project analyzes credit default risks using various machine learning models to enhance risk assessment accuracy. By comparing classifiers like XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM, the study aims to provide insights into their strengths, limitations, and implications for the financial industry. The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
